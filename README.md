# Campus


This platform allows the creation of mixed reality experiences, which can be viewed through smart glasses. The experiences are created from our campus project where users with a basic knowledge of unity can create and upload them to our platform by using IPFS and stored within Moralis. After that it is possible to generate NFT, and sell it through our market, which was built on the avalanche blockchain.

The user registers with Moralis and Metamask within the Campus platform, after registering they can upload the files to the Moralis IPFS system and generate the NTF authenticating with Metamask by deploying the smart contract in Avalanche. In order to download NFTs from the Moralis IPFS system within Mixed Reality headsets (Oculus, Hololens 2, Magic Leap, and any VR and Mixed Reality headsets), you need to authenticate with Moralis. The following table graphically shows the process.
